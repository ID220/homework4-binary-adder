The **objectives** of this homework are to learn:

- how to use MOSFET and combine them in digital gates
- bitwise operations - how to add up two bytes

## Content of this folder

- [_SubmissionForm.md_](./SubmissionForm.md): the form containing the information about your submission.
- _src_: the template code to start the project
- _data_: a folder with the schematics and images used in this document.
- _README_: this file, containing the instructions.

## How does the adder work?

## Bill of Material (BOM)

| Designator | Name | Quantity |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |

## Details about the Firmware Firmware

The firmware should be written in MicroPython and should run on the micro:bit.

## Submission and grading

You have to submit the following items:

1. The submission form containing your information and video link: [_SubmissionForm.md_](./SubmissionForm.md)
2. Clear photos (3 max) of your breadboard circuit
3. Your MicroPython sketch with the code

Take clear photos of your breadboard, the [_SubmissionForm.md_](./SubmissionForm.md), and the code, zip them together (_zip_, not _ALZIP_, _rar_ or others) and submit this resulting file using the [homework submission system](https://homework.prototyping.id). Make sure the zip file is smaller than 20MB.

**DO NOT SUBMIT THE VIDEO USING THE HOMEWORK SYSTEM**. Instead, upload the video online (YouTube, Google Drive...) and place a public link to the video inside the [_SubmissionForm.md_](./SubmissionForm.md) file. The video should show a working demo of your prototype. Feel free to use a voice-over explaining how the system is working.

Please note that:

1. Only submissions made with the system will be considered (no direct emails to TA or Prof).
2. You can re-submit as many times as you want before the deadline &ndash; we will consider your last submission.
3. Submissions after the deadline are **NOT** accepted.
4. If the file is too large the system wonâ€™t allow the submission. Remove from the zip file unnecessary files, and make sure to compress your images.
5. Do not copy from the Internet or colleagues without attribution. Remember the _honor code policy_.
